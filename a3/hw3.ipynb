    "This assignment will help you transition from tabular approaches, topic of HW 2, to deep neural network approaches. You will implement the [Atari DQN / Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) algorithm, which arguably kicked off the modern Deep Reinforcement Learning craze.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will use PyTorch as our deep learning framework.  To familiarize yourself with PyTorch, your first task is to use a behavior cloning (BC) approach to learn a policy.  Behavior cloning is a supervised learning method in which there exists a dataset of expert demonstrations (state-action pairs) and the goal is to learn a policy $\\pi$ that mimics this expert.  At any given state, your policy should choose the same action the export would.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since BC avoids the need to collect data from the policy you are trying to learn, it is relatively simple. \n",
    "This makes it a nice stepping stone for implementing DQN. Furthermore, BC is relevant to modern approaches---for example its use as an initialization for systems like [AlphaGo][go] and [AlphaStar][star], which then use RL to further adapte the BC result.  \n",

    "it's not always possible to have good expert demonstrations for a task in an environemnt and this is where reinforcement learning comes handy.
